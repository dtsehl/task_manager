# README

This was a good introduction to the basics of Ruby on Rails. I feel I grasped the concepts that were discussed while doing them with a decent amount of understanding.

It was a fairly straightforward exercise and while I had a few config issues early on (for example the command `psql` was not being recognized by Zsh) through Googling I was able to solve them.
